a)
The query:
select relpages from pg_class where relname = 'customers_country';
returns:

 relpages
----------
       59
(1 row)
The customers_country index occupies 59 pages.

b)
The query:
explain select * from customers where country='Japan';
returns:
                          QUERY PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on customers  (cost=0.00..721.00 rows=995 width=156)
   Filter: ((country)::text = 'Japan'::text)
(2 rows)
and still has an access method of Sequential Scan, and still has an expected cost of 721.

c)
The non-clustered index does not lead to any benefits, as it does not actually provide a more efficient way to access the data, and does not usefully presort it. Adding a clause of "where country='Japan'" to the end of the index would increase efficiency.

d)
The query:
explain select * from customers where country='Japan';

Now accesses with an Index Scan using customers_country on customers, with an Index condition of ((country)::text = 'Japan'::text).
There is now an estimated cost of 56.66, this is the best plan for these queries, as the estimated cost is 664.34 less than the original cost wihtout clustering.

                                       QUERY PLAN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using customers_country on customers  (cost=0.00..56.66 rows=995 width=156
   Index Cond: ((country)::text = 'Japan'::text)
(2 rows)


e)
Both queries plan to use scan using coutry='Japan' first, but the clustered query plans to use this as an index condition, whereas the unclustered query plans to use this as a filter.
After, the clustered query will use an Index scan on the customers_country index, and the unclustered query will use a sequential scan.
The clustered query also executes with an estimated cost of 644.34 less than the estimated cost of the unclustered query.
