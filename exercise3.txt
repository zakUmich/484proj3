a)
The query:
select relpages from pg_class where relname = 'customers_country';
returns:

 relpages
----------
       59
(1 row)
The customers_country index occupies 59 pages.

b)
The query:
explain select * from customers where country='Japan';
returns:
                          QUERY PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on customers  (cost=0.00..721.00 rows=995 width=156)
   Filter: ((country)::text = 'Japan'::text)
(2 rows)
and still has an access method of Sequential Scan, and still has an expected cost of 721.

c)


d)
The query:
explain select * from customers where country='Japan';
Now accesses with an Index Scan using customers_country on customers, with an Index condition of ((country)::text = 'Japan'::text).
There is now an estimated cost of 56.66, this is the best plan for these queries, as the estimated cost is 664.34 less than the original cost wihtout clustering.
